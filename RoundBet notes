Round Bet notes.

-multiple ion-view on template 
There can be only one ion-view. unless you explicity specify which part of the screen that you want to the view to occupy.

-ion-tab and state activation.
ion-tab are dependent on state activation inorder to function. so you have to include either href or ui-sref.

-ion-nav-view in parent and child templates.
If you have <ion-nav-view> in the parent template, you do not need to include it in the child templates as this is often a cause of error in scripts. As pages will not be rendered proprely.

-Title tag in ion-nav-view
Do not add the title tag in the ion-nav-view,  add it in the ion-view for each template to be rendered.

- Adding two templates in one parent. This can not work as it tries to render both at thesame time. for example i tried to add <ion-nav-view> for welcome page and login on thesame home.htm templates.
