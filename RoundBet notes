Round Bet notes.

There can be only one ion-view. unless you explicity specify which part of the screen that you want to the view to occupy.

ion-tab are dependent on state activation inorder to function. so you have to include either href or ui-sref.

If you have <ion-nav-view> in the parent template, you do not need to include it in the child templates as this is often a cause of error in scripts.

Do not add the title tag in the ion-nav-view,  add it in the ion-view for each template to be rendered.
