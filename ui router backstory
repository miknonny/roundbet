-> ui rounter module contains $sateProvider and $urlRouterProvider

Comparing rounter and state.
A state is place within your app.
A router is like a url within your app.

In states thereis a nested hierachy you can have children and parents but in routes you just have a flat hierachy. you can go from one route to the next.

Note that the name of a state is just a name like 'contacts' but in routes the name could be a url like '/contacts';

you can navigate to a state by its name or the url.
but in route you can navigate by its url only.


in states you can have multiple views(ui-view) that can live at the same level. but with routes you can have only a single view using ng-view.

state can populate any view but with route you populate the one view that you get.

states can populate the parts of your application and also the diffrent quadrants of your screen. but with routes you are on your own to use directives to populate the different parts of your application.

Now lets assume the both of them



$stateProvider
    .state('home', {
      url: '/home',
      abstract: true,
      templateUrl: 'templates/home.html'
    })

 $routeProvider.when('/contacts/:id' {
 	template: 'hello',
 	templateUrl: contacts.html,
 	controllers: Myctrl
 })

note that in ngroute, when is the main method for adding routes.  
In ui.router it is just for creating redirect.

make sure to add UI-router to your head and include it as a dependecy top your module.

Nesting is the main feature of ui routeer.


A typical use case for nesting.
we could have an index.html file. we can have a list to the right side of the document using the ui-view. and when i clickk i want to see the content of each item to the right still using the view that i described.

Note here that we went from a list to a list.detail and this nesting means that we do not have to reload the whole page we only have to reload what has changed on the page.


Note that for deeply nested state the dot notation can become difficult to read and this can be rewritten.
    .state('home.signup', {
      url:'/signup',
      templateUrl: 'signup.html',
      controller: 'SignupCtrl'
    });

Note that we have now assigned the parent property a property of home.
    .state('signup', {
      url:'/signup',
      templateUrl: 'signup.html',
      controller: 'SignupCtrl',
      parent: 'home'
    });
We should consider this if we have states that are more than five states deep.

Object based state is another alternative for deep linked states.

var home = {
	state: 'home',
	templateUrl = contact.html
}

var signup = {
	state: 'signup.html',
	parent: 'home',
	templateUrl: signup.html
}

$stateProvider
	.state('home')
	.state('signup')

Inheritance.

Inheritance.
Child states always inherit from their parent state.


note that we can use the data property to stare anything that is custom.


$stateProvider
	.state('parent', {
		data: {
		customdata1: 'hello',
		customdata2: 'world'
		};
	})

	.state('child', {
		// custom data one is inherited from the parent but // will overite customdata2
		customData2: UI-Router
	});

$rootScope.$on('$stateChangeStart',
	function (event, toState)) {
		var greeting = tostate.data.custom1 + " " + toState.data.custom2;
		console.log(greeting);
	}

Activating a state. 

What happens when a state is activated ?

1. first it is going to merge any option we define with the default option.

2. secondly it is going to see if the state is defined or else it will broadcast $stateNotFound.

3. it will merge the parameters of that state with all the ancestor parameters.

4. next it will figure out which states are changing and which arent. note that if we are going to thesame state and no parameters have changed, there will be no transiction except we have set a reload to true.

5. Next it will broadcast $stateChangeStart.

6. Next it resolves all the locals for the newly activated state. once those locals are resolved that is when the real transition actually begins.


Activating a chid state.
Scenario 1: jump right into your app with  url of:
/contacts/1/edit.
1. activate implicit root state.
2. Activate the contact state.
3. Activate the contact.detail.
4. activate the contact.detail.edit


Scenario2: from there we click contact 2.
1. edit the contact.detail.edit state
2. exit the contact.detail
3. Activate the contact.detail for contact2.

Callbacks.
You can register an onEnter and an onExit for your scope.
	
$stateProvider
	.state('contact', {
		template: '<p>hello</p>',
		resolve:
		controller: myCtrl
	}),
	onEnter: function (title) {
		if (title) {... do something ...}
	},
	onExit: function (title) {
		if (title) {... do something ...} 
	};


How to activate a state.
there are three ways to activate a state.

There are 3 ways to activate a state.
1. state.go()
2. using the s-ref
3. you can manually navigate to the state urls manually.


1. $state.go();
This is the programmatic way to naviagate to scope.

myApp.controller('contactCtrl', ['$scope', '$state',
	function ($scope, $state) {
		$state.go('contact.details', {id: selectedId})
	};
]);

this is how it is done on controllers, your on enters and handlers.

parameters for state.go()
1. state name
2. state parameters.
3. options

Relative Navigation.

We can move relative to the current state.
by using special characters.
^ is up.
. is down

UI-sref
This is a directive that comes with the state router.
it stands for state reference and is used in place of href.

<a ui-sref="home"></a>

This is really nice because if you change your urls later on.
You do not have to go and change them  in  your application.

Note that behind the scenes if does compile to the href.

<a ui-sref="home" href="#/home">home</a>


You can also passing parameters to ui-sref.

<li ng-repeat="contact in contacts"> 
	<a ui-sref="contact.detail({ id: contact.id })">
</li>

we can also use relative paths.
<a ui-sref='^'>


Nested Urls go handsomely with nested state urls.$stateProvider
	.state('contacts', {
		urls: '/contacts'
	});
	.state('contacts.list', {
		urls: '/lsit'
	});
We can also prepend the list with '^' careful not to shot
yourself on the foot.

.state('contact.list', {
	url: '^list'
})
this navigates to #/list instead of #/contacts/list.
This means that you can have nested states with out having their routes be nested.

even through the list is a child its route feels like a top tier url.

note that if your state is nested 3 levels deep. the '^' will
still start at the root.

URL Parameters


Basic parameters
urls: '/contacts/:contactId'
urls: '/contact/{contactId}'

Regex Parametes
The curly bracket syntax is realy useful if you are doing regex.

this one looks for a contactId that is a hexadecimal.
urls: '/contact/{contactId:{0-9a-fA-F}{1,0}}'

Query Parameters.

urls: '/contacts?contactId&contactRegion'



$stateParams.
When we activate a state via url and the url has parameters then the stateParams is going to get populated with those values.


State url
url: '/users/:id/details/{type}/{repeat: [0-9]+}?from&to' 


// Navigate to.
'/users/123/detail//0'

State params will be.

{id: '123', type: '', repeat:'0' };

//Navigate to
'/users/123/details/default/0?from=there&to=here'

// $stateParams will be 

{id: 123, type: default, repeat:0 , from: 'here', to: 'here'}

Now if i do navigate and passing all the parameters it will populate them all out.

			stateParams Caveats
$stateParams is only activated when the state is activated and all the dependencies are resolved.


Multiple Named views.

Pros.
- provides flexibility
- you get to have multiple views in any template.
- Great for singleton top level component. (side panel modal.
- many devs put them to great use.


Cons.
- They are often unnecssary trying to next first.
- leading cause of confusion.
- They can lead to anti patterns.

Quick concept.
By default this is a root state that is always active.
{
	name: '',
	url: '*',
	'abstract': true
};

No name
url is absolute root.
Can't activate it directly.
Most important: its "template" is your index.html


for example you can not access the tab.html directly but you can access the different tabs that are in the tab.html. you can not access the friends tab and the account tab at once. only one view can be present at a time.

this is useful in templates in which two views can not co-exist in one template at thesame time. only one is called at a time.

Naming views.
This is mandatory if you have two or more views that are leaving at thesame level.

<div ui-view="main">
<div ui-view="sidenav">


Configure Multiple Views.
Use the views config object.

Each key is a view name and each value is a view config object.

$stateProvider
	.state('deep.down.state.mainbits', {
		url: "url/still/goes/up/here",
		view: {
			'main@': { ... },    //main view at root state
			'sidenav@': { ... }  // sidenav at root state.
		}
	});

View Name.
Can use absolute or relative naming.

Relative(always parent)
'main' - 'main' view in the parent template.
'' - unamed view in the parent template.

Absolute.
'list@contacts' - 'list' view in 'contacts' state's template.
'list@' list view in index.html. Notice that the right side is empty and this is saying the root, the unamed state. the state that shall remain unamed.

'@'- this targets the unamed view in index.html


Very important for designing views.
1. what quadrants(views) are depenent on other quadrants.
if it depends on it then  nest it inside the other one.

Are multiple quadrants dependent on thesame parent.
And do the quadrants really need to be seperated.

Abstract state.
This is a state that can not be directly activated.

They can have children and can become activated implicity when any of its children are activated.

They are a great place to do work. this is a sort of like a common umbrella for work that needs to be done.


Abstract state Usages.

- to prepend a url to its child state urls.
- To set a template its child state will activate.
 optionally assign a controller to the template.
- provide scope properties and methods for children to inherit.
- Resolve dependencies for child states.
- To set custom data for child state or event to use.
- To run an onEnter or an onExit function.
- Any combination of the above.

Note that the abtstact will need its own ui-view if the child state decides to populate it.
